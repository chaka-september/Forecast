# Forecast

A weather app, which displays the 5day forecast for your current location

## Steps to run

I'm assuming Android studio has been downloaded and installed correctly with a suitable SDK
if you need to download android studio please see this link: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

1. Download or locally clone the repository
2. Sign up to open weather map and create an api key
3. Create a file called key.properties in the root directory
4. Put your api key into this file as follows: weather_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
5. Open project with Android Studio
6. Attach device or create emulator
6. Run app and choose which device/emulator you'd like to run the app on

## Given more time I would:

I'd like to add icons for the different weather types

Update the App icon

Better error handling

Caching with a timeout threshold so the user is limited to the number of calls which they can make
